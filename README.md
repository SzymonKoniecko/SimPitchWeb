SimPitchWeb is the visualization and configuration frontend for the Football Match Simulator. 
Built with Vue 3 and Vite, this application provides an interactive interface to control the C# .NET simulation engine, 
allowing users to configure simulation strategies (Poisson, Dixon-Coles, Momentum), visualizae team strengths (Posterior vs. Likelihood), and analyze match outcomes.

Dashboard & League Selection
The main hub for selecting leagues and viewing current simulation states. <br />

Simulation Configuration (La Liga Example)
Setting up a new simulation run. Here you define the parameters such as the Seed for reproducibility and the specific MatchSimulationStrategy to be used by the backend DDD engine.

Statistical Legend
Understanding the metrics is key. The legend explains the difference between Posterior (Bayesian long-term strength) and Likelihood (short-term form/momentum).

Iteration Preview
A view into the specific iteration (e.g., Matchday 3 of a simulated season), showing the probabilistic setup before matches are resolved.

Match Results
The final output of the simulation, displaying scores generated by the selected statistical model (e.g., Dixon-Coles correcting for low-scoring draws).
